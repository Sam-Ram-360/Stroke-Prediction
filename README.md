# Stroke-Prediction

In this Jupyter file, I extensively preprocessed the stroke dataset using Python and its libraries. The preprocessing steps involved handling null values, transforming non-numerical fields into numeric values using the OneHotEncoder technique, and addressing the issue of dataset imbalance through oversampling. Finally, I normalized the dataset using the minMaxScaler function.

Furthermore, I implemented several machine learning algorithms such as random forest, XGBoost, SVM, and MultiLayer Perceptron. To ensure the models were robust and not suffering from overfitting, I conducted cross-validation and compared their performances. This comprehensive analysis allowed for a thorough evaluation of the different models and their suitability for the stroke dataset.
